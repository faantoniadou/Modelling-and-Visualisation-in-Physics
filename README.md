# Modelling and Visualisation in Physics
I took this course during my Computational Physics BSc (Hons) degree at the University of Edinburgh. The course covers the process of mapping a scientific problem onto a computer algorithm to enable it to be modelled, along with an introduction to visualisation techniques, to help visualise the solution.
