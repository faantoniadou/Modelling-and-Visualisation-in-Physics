# Modelling and Visualisation in Physics
I took this course during my Computational Physics BSc (Hons) degree at the University of Edinburgh. The course covers the process of mapping a scientific problem onto a computer algorithm to enable it to be modelled, along with an introduction to visualisation techniques, to help visualise the solution. 

Theoretical background of core simulation techniques include:
1. Monte-Carlo integration and Monte-Carlo simulations 
2. Cellular automata
3. Molecular dynamics simulations OR Partial differential equations (depending on year) 

* Implementation of these core techniques in Python to solve specific (and potentially unseen) physics problems

* Integration of visualisation (evolving fields, moving particles, live graphs etc) and graphical user interfaces into simulation codes

* The notion and origin of errors and instabilities in numerical algorithms, and simple techniques for handling them

* Key issues that arise in the development of scientific software, such as: compromises between efficiency and flexibility, the incorporation of third-party library code (and its distinction from plagiarism) and the utility of good-quality documentation and coding style
